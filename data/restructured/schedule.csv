It describes the way that time was spent in Scotland in 2020 by different population characteristics and adds to the time-use gender analysis published in December 2020. The equality analysis report focuses on the ways time use differed by several equality characteristics, and the ways these characteristics intersected with each other. This data provides an update to the 2014/15 Time Use Survey by Centre for Time Use, University of Oxford, a Scotland-specific analysis of which was published by the Scottish Government in March 2019. The survey will provide important insights into how time was spent in Scotland during the COVID-19 lockdown and subsequent restrictions, and how this time use varied depending on population characteristics, e.g. age, disability. In the survey, participants filled in online time use diaries detailing their daily activities. The main activities analysed in this report are paid work (from home or away from home), unpaid work (housework/cooking; household management; childcare; travel; study, other), free-time (e.g. watching television or hiking), and personal care (e.g. sleeping or eating).","Jon Hunter

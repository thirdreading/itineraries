In the survey, participants filled in online time use diaries detailing their daily activities.

The sex analysis report focuses on the ways time use differed between men and women. This publication is part of the Time Use in Scotland time series and the data provides an update to the 2020 data published by the Scottish Government, and the 2014/15 Time Use Survey by Centre for Time Use, University of Oxford, a Scotland-specific analysis published by the Scottish Government in March 2019. The survey will provide important insights into how time was spent in Scotland in a post-pandemic period, when the public health restrictions related to COVID-19 were fully lifted. In the survey, participants filled in online time use diaries detailing their daily activities. The main activities analysed in this report are paid work (from home or away from home), unpaid work (housework/cooking; household management; childcare; travel; study, other), free-time (e.g. watching television or hiking), and personal care (e.g. sleeping or eating).",

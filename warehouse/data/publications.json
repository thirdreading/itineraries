This data provides an update to the 2014/15 Time Use Survey by Centre for Time Use, University of Oxford, a Scotland-specific analysis of which was published by the Scottish Government in March 2019.

In the survey, participants filled in online time use diaries detailing their daily activities. The main activities analysed in this report are paid work (from home or away from home), unpaid work (housework/cooking; household management; childcare; travel; study, other), free-time (e.g. watching television or hiking), and personal care (e.g. sleeping or eating).",
